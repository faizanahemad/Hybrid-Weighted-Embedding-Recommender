<h1>Content and Use of Files</h1>

<h2>Verifying the Dataset Contents</h2>

<p>We encourage you to verify that the dataset you have on your computer is identical to the ones hosted at <a href="http://grouplens.org/">grouplens.org</a>.  This is an important step if you downloaded the dataset from a location other than <a href="http://grouplens.org/">grouplens.org</a>, or if you wish to publish research results based on analysis of the MovieLens dataset.</p>

<p>We provide a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum">MD5 checksum</a> with the same name as the downloadable <code>.zip</code> file, but with a <code>.md5</code> file extension. To verify the dataset:</p>

<pre><code># on linux
md5sum ml-20m.zip; cat ml-20m.zip.md5

# on OSX
md5 ml-20m.zip; cat ml-20m.zip.md5

# windows users can download a tool from Microsoft (or elsewhere) that verifies MD5 checksums
</code></pre>

<p>Check that the two lines of output contain the same hash value.</p>

<h2>Formatting and Encoding</h2>

<p>The dataset files are written as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">comma-separated values</a> files with a single header row. Columns that contain commas (<code>,</code>) are escaped using double-quotes (<code>"</code>). These files are encoded as UTF-8. If accented characters in movie titles or tag values (e.g. Mis√©rables, Les (1995)) display incorrectly, make sure that any program reading the data, such as a text editor, terminal, or script, is configured for UTF-8.</p>

<h2>User Ids</h2>

<p>MovieLens users were selected at random for inclusion. Their ids have been anonymized. User ids are consistent between <code>ratings.csv</code> and <code>tags.csv</code> (i.e., the same id refers to the same user across the two files).</p>

<h2>Movie Ids</h2>

<p>Only movies with at least one rating or tag are included in the dataset. These movie ids are consistent with those used on the MovieLens web site (e.g., id <code>1</code> corresponds to the URL <a href="https://movielens.org/movies/1">https://movielens.org/movies/1</a>). Movie ids are consistent between <code>ratings.csv</code>, <code>tags.csv</code>, <code>movies.csv</code>, and <code>links.csv</code> (i.e., the same id refers to the same movie across these four data files).</p>

<h2>Ratings Data File Structure (ratings.csv)</h2>

<p>All ratings are contained in the file <code>ratings.csv</code>. Each line of this file after the header row represents one rating of one movie by one user, and has the following format:</p>

<pre><code>userId,movieId,rating,timestamp
</code></pre>

<p>The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.</p>

<p>Ratings are made on a 5-star scale, with half-star increments (0.5 stars - 5.0 stars).</p>

<p>Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.</p>

<h2>Tags Data File Structure (tags.csv)</h2>

<p>All tags are contained in the file <code>tags.csv</code>. Each line of this file after the header row represents one tag applied to one movie by one user, and has the following format:</p>

<pre><code>userId,movieId,tag,timestamp
</code></pre>

<p>The lines within this file are ordered first by userId, then, within user, by movieId.</p>

<p>Tags are user-generated metadata about movies. Each tag is typically a single word or short phrase. The meaning, value, and purpose of a particular tag is determined by each user.</p>

<p>Timestamps represent seconds since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) of January 1, 1970.</p>

<h2>Movies Data File Structure (movies.csv)</h2>

<p>Movie information is contained in the file <code>movies.csv</code>. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:</p>

<pre><code>movieId,title,genres
</code></pre>

<p>Movie titles are entered manually or imported from <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">https://www.themoviedb.org/</a>, and include the year of release in parentheses. Errors and inconsistencies may exist in these titles.</p>

<p>Genres are a pipe-separated list, and are selected from the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Action</li>
<li>Adventure</li>
<li>Animation</li>
<li>Children's</li>
<li>Comedy</li>
<li>Crime</li>
<li>Documentary</li>
<li>Drama</li>
<li>Fantasy</li>
<li>Film-Noir</li>
<li>Horror</li>
<li>Musical</li>
<li>Mystery</li>
<li>Romance</li>
<li>Sci-Fi</li>
<li>Thriller</li>
<li>War</li>
<li>Western</li>
<li>(no genres listed)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Links Data File Structure (links.csv)</h2>

<p>Identifiers that can be used to link to other sources of movie data are contained in the file <code>links.csv</code>. Each line of this file after the header row represents one movie, and has the following format:</p>

<pre><code>movieId,imdbId,tmdbId
</code></pre>

<p>movieId is an identifier for movies used by <a href="https://movielens.org/">https://movielens.org</a>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <a href="https://movielens.org/movies/1">https://movielens.org/movies/1</a>.</p>

<p>imdbId is an identifier for movies used by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">http://www.imdb.com</a>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/</a>.</p>

<p>tmdbId is an identifier for movies used by <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">https://www.themoviedb.org</a>. E.g., the movie Toy Story has the link <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862">https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/862</a>.</p>

<p>Use of the resources listed above is subject to the terms of each provider.</p>

<h2>Tag Genome (genome-scores.csv and genome-tags.csv)</h2>

<p>This data set includes a current copy of the Tag Genome.</p>

<p>The tag genome is a data structure that contains tag relevance scores for movies.  The structure is a dense matrix: each movie in the genome has a value for <em>every</em> tag in the genome.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="http://files.grouplens.org/papers/tag_genome.pdf">this article</a>, the tag genome encodes how strongly movies exhibit particular properties represented by tags (atmospheric, thought-provoking, realistic, etc.). The tag genome was computed using a machine learning algorithm on user-contributed content including tags, ratings, and textual reviews.</p>

<p>The genome is split into two files.  The file <code>genome-scores.csv</code> contains movie-tag relevance data in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>movieId,tagId,relevance
</code></pre>

<p>The second file, <code>genome-tags.csv</code>, provides the tag descriptions for the tag IDs in the genome file, in the following format:</p>

<pre><code>tagId,tag
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>tagId</code> values are generated when the data set is exported, so they may vary from version to version of the MovieLens data sets.</p>

<h2>Cross-Validation</h2>

<p>Prior versions of the MovieLens dataset included either pre-computed cross-folds or scripts to perform this computation. We no longer bundle either of these features with the dataset, since most modern toolkits provide this as a built-in feature. If you wish to learn about standard approaches to cross-fold computation in the context of recommender systems evaluation, see <a href="http://lenskit.org/">LensKit</a> for tools, documentation, and open-source code examples.</p>
